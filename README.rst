Get started with flask MVC in 30 minutes. This boilerplate skeleton includes everything to get you up and running with flask. The collection of packages bundled with this boilerplate represents a selection of packages I have found extremely helpful when getting an app up and running as quick as possible.

This skeleton is part of the flask-boilerplate project.

- `flask-boilerplate <https://github.com/nickw444/Flask-Boilerplate>`_
- `flask-boilerplate-buildutils <https://github.com/nickw444/flask-boilerplate-buildutils>`_
- `flask-boilerplate-utils <https://github.com/nickw444/flask-boilerplate-utils>`_

Features
*******************
- Promotes the use of `virtual environments <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/>`_ through `autoenv <https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv>`_. 

- Abstracted boilerplate utilities in `flask-boilerplate-buildutils <http://flask-boilerplate-buildutils.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ and `flask-boilerplate-utils <http://flask-boilerplate-utils.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_  - you can always upgrade to the latest and greatest without restructuring your skeleton.
- Instantly ready for deployment. Never mess around with gunicorn again. See :doc:`deployment` for more details on how to deploy using supervisor and nginx.
- Abstracted models module, using raw SQLAlchemy (which are then imported to flask-sqlalchemy). Prevents circular imports and allows you to share the models with non flask apps, such as a web sockets server.
- Abstracted config module, share the configuration between multiple python apps. 
- Many additional helper decorators and functions included in flask-boilerplate-utils.
