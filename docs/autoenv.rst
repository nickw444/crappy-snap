Getting Started With Autoenv
==================================================

Autoenv is a magical shell extension developed by @kennethreitz. It's available `here <https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv>`_. 

Autoenv will automatically execute a directory containing a .env file. Combine this with the boilerplate's smart .env file, you can have some very smart automatic virtual environment switching. 

This means you won't have to type ``source .env`` every time you access your project.

Install autoenv by viewing @kennethreitz's instructions `here <https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv#install>`_.
